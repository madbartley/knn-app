# knn-app

K-NN, or K-Nearest Neighbors, is a simple algorithm that aims to predict a data point based on the labels of the closest "k" other data points. The webpage here analyzes breast tumor data, and attempts to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on the nearest k=3 neighbors. Users have the option of entering in their own information, or clicking a button to generate sample data.

After spending some time learning and building projects with Django, I wanted to try working with Flask! I've also been studying Machine Learning this summer, and I thought combining some webdev work with ML practice would be a great exercise. 

I really enjoyed this introduction to Flask, and I'm excited to work more with it in the future!
